    With the
    <mark>
     general population aging
    </mark>
    and thus more patients developing bothersome
    <mark>
     erectile dysfunction
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     stress urinary incontinence
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     overactive bladder
    </mark>
    , there will likely be a higher demand for three common interactive implants in urology, the
    <mark>
     penile prosthesis
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     artificial urinary sphincter (AUS)
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     sacral neuromodulation (SNM)
    </mark>
    . Further, the prevalence of
    <mark>
     mild neurocognitive disorders
    </mark>
    (also known as mild cognitive impairment) and
    <mark>
     major neurocognitive disorders
    </mark>
    (also known as dementia, respectively) is expected to increase. While the aforementioned urologic implants have excellent short and long term outcomes, there are also known
    <mark>
     device issues
    </mark>
    such as
    <mark>
     malfunction
    </mark>
    or
    <mark>
     misuse
    </mark>
    that may require
    <mark>
     surgical removal
    </mark>
    and/or
    <mark>
     revision
    </mark>
    . The objective of this narrative review is to describe the association of
    <mark>
     cognitive impairment
    </mark>
    and urologic implants. We performed a search on PubMed between the years 1975-2023 for English language articles that reported on any type or severity of
    <mark>
     cognitive impairment
    </mark>
    and its association with
    <mark>
     penile prosthesis
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     AUS
    </mark>
    and/or
    <mark>
     SNM
    </mark>
    . While peer-reviewed published manuscripts were prioritized, abstracts that fit our search criteria were also included. Data assessing outcomes of patients with
    <mark>
     cognitive impairment
    </mark>
    who undergo placement of a urologic implant are limited. There is an association between
    <mark>
     AUS failure
    </mark>
    or
    <mark>
     misuse
    </mark>
    with
    <mark>
     cognitive impairment
    </mark>
    .
    <mark>
     SNM
    </mark>
    is
    <mark>
     efficacious
    </mark>
    in this population in the short term. In patients who develop
    <mark>
     dementia
    </mark>
    , an
    <mark>
     inflatable penile prosthesis
    </mark>
    can be deflated via in-office needle puncture and an
    <mark>
     AUS
    </mark>
    can be
    <mark>
     deactivated
    </mark>
    . The
    <mark>
     Memory Alteration Test
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     Quick Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment
    </mark>
    and the
    <mark>
     Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination
    </mark>
    are relatively quick screening tests with good sensitivity and specificity for mild cognitive impairment. While data on the association between urologic implants and
    <mark>
     cognitive impairment
    </mark>
    are sparse, there are tools that urologists can use to screen patients for
    <mark>
     cognitive impairment
    </mark>
    . With screening, urologists can provide appropriate
    <mark>
     preoperative counseling
    </mark>
    (including recommending against implantation) and can provide closer
    <mark>
     postoperative monitoring
    </mark>
    . Further study is required to assess which patients should be excluded from device implantation and how to properly assess for
    <mark>
     cognitive impairment
    </mark>
    in a manner that is both beneficial for the patient and convenient and efficient for a urologist.
