    Higher levels of
    <mark>
     frailty
    </mark>
    , quantified by a
    <mark>
     frailty index (FI)
    </mark>
    , may be linked to
    <mark>
     fatigue severity
    </mark>
    as tasks become more physically and mentally demanding. Fatigue, a component of frailty research, has been ambiguous and inconsistent in its operationalization.
    <mark>
     Fatigability
    </mark>
    -the quantification of vulnerability to fatigue in relation to specific intensity and duration of activities-offers a more sensitive and standardized approach, though the association between
    <mark>
     frailty
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     fatigability
    </mark>
    has not been assessed. Using cross-sectional data from the
    <mark>
     Long Life Family Study
    </mark>
    at Visit 2 (2014-2017; N = 2524; mean age ± standard deviation (SD) 71.4 ± 11.2 years; 55% women; 99% White), we examined associations between an 83-item FI after excluding fatigue items (ratio of number of
    <mark>
     health problems
    </mark>
    reported (numerator) out of the total assessed (denominator); higher ratio = greater frailty) and perceived
    <mark>
     physical
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     mental fatigability
    </mark>
    using the
    <mark>
     Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS)
    </mark>
    (range 0-50; higher scores = greater fatigability). Participants had mean ± standard deviation FI (0.08 ± 0.06; observed range: 0.0-0.43), PFS Physical (13.7 ± 9.6; 39.5% more severe, ≥15), and PFS Mental (7.9 ± 8.9; 22.8% more severe, ≥13). The prevalence of more severe
    <mark>
     physical
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     mental fatigability
    </mark>
    was higher across FI quartiles. In
    <mark>
     mixed effects models
    </mark>
    accounting for
    <mark>
     family structure
    </mark>
    , a clinically meaningful 3%-higher FI was associated with 1.9 points higher PFS Physical score (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-2.1) and 1.7 points higher PFS Mental score (95% CI 1.5-1.9) after adjusting for covariates.
    <mark>
     Frailty
    </mark>
    was associated with perceived
    <mark>
     physical
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     mental fatigability
    </mark>
    severity. Understanding this association may support the development of
    <mark>
     interventions
    </mark>
    to mitigate the risks associated with greater
    <mark>
     frailty
    </mark>
    and perceived
    <mark>
     fatigability
    </mark>
    . Including measurements of perceived
    <mark>
     fatigability
    </mark>
    , in lieu of fatigue, in
    <mark>
     frailty indices
    </mark>
    has the potential to alleviate the inconsistencies and ambiguity surrounding the operationalization of fatigue and provide a more precise and sensitive measurement of
    <mark>
     frailty
    </mark>
    .
