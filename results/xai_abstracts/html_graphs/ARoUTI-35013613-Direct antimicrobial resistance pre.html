     Early use of effective antimicrobial treatments
    </mark>
    is critical for the
    <mark>
     outcome of infections
    </mark>
    and the
    <mark>
     prevention of treatment resistance
    </mark>
    .
    <mark>
     Antimicrobial resistance testing
    </mark>
    enables the selection of
    <mark>
     optimal antibiotic treatments
    </mark>
    , but
    <mark>
     current culture-based techniques
    </mark>
    can take up to 72â€‰hours to generate results. We have developed a novel
    <mark>
     machine learning approach
    </mark>
    to
    <mark>
     predict antimicrobial resistance
    </mark>
    directly from
    <mark>
     matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra profiles
    </mark>
    of
    <mark>
     clinical isolates
    </mark>
    . We trained
    <mark>
     calibrated classifiers
    </mark>
    on a newly created
    <mark>
     publicly available database
    </mark>
    of
    <mark>
     mass spectra profiles
    </mark>
    from the clinically most relevant isolates with linked
    <mark>
     antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes
    </mark>
    . This dataset combines more than 300,000 mass spectra with more than 750,000 antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from four medical institutions. Validation on a panel of clinically important pathogens, including
    <mark>
     Staphylococcus aureus
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     Escherichia coli
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     Klebsiella pneumoniae
    </mark>
    , resulting in
    <mark>
     areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve
    </mark>
    of 0.80, 0.74 and 0.74, respectively, demonstrated the potential of using machine learning to substantially
    <mark>
     accelerate antimicrobial resistance determination
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     change of clinical management
    </mark>
    . Furthermore, a
    <mark>
     retrospective clinical case study
    </mark>
    of 63 patients found that implementing this approach would have changed the
    <mark>
     clinical treatment
    </mark>
    in nine cases, which would have been beneficial in eight cases (89%).
    <mark>
     MALDI-TOF mass spectra-based machine learning
    </mark>
    may thus be an important new tool for
    <mark>
     treatment optimization
    </mark>
    and

     antibiotic stewardship
