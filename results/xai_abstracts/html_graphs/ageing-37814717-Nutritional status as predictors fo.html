    Individuals with
    <mark>
     severe cerebral palsy (CP)
    </mark>
    often experience various health issues, including
    <mark>
     feeding difficulties
    </mark>
    , which can adversely affect their
    <mark>
     nutritional status
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     caregivers' quality of life
    </mark>
    , e.g., more time spent for feeding rather than own selfcare. This study aimed to determine the
    <mark>
     prevalence of poor nutritional status
    </mark>
    among individuals with severe CP and explore its role as
    <mark>
     predictors for caregivers' quality of life
    </mark>
    . This cross-sectional study was conducted in a government hospital (Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital), Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Program, and Spastic Centre [non-profit organization (NGO)] in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Seventy-one participants with
    <mark>
     Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level IV and V
    </mark>
    were recruited. Sociodemographic data, health-associated data, and anthropometric data were collected.
    <mark>
     Caregivers' quality of life
    </mark>
    was assessed using the
    <mark>
     Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) CP module version 3.0
    </mark>
    which included domains such as Movement and Balance, Eating Activities, and School Activities. Most participants were males (60.6%), with 61 classified as level IV in the GMFCS classification. According to the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS), 59 children were at level IV. In total, 40.8% were
    <mark>
     underweight
    </mark>
    according to CP growth chart and 49.3% had
    <mark>
     mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)
    </mark>
    readings below the 5th percentile. The lowest scores in the PedsQL CP module version 3.0 were observed in the
    <mark>
     Daily Activities domain
    </mark>
    (5.34±10.87), and
    <mark>
     School Activities domain
    </mark>
    (8.15±18.65). Sociodemographic and anthropometric data, including
    <mark>
     body mass index (BMI)-for-age
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     MUAC
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     body fat
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     triceps
    </mark>
    , and
    <mark>
     subscapular skinfold measurement
    </mark>
    , were predictors for the School Activities domain [F (11, 44)=3.981, P&lt;0.005, R2=0.499]. Poor nutritional status in individuals with severe CP has been shown to negatively impact
    <mark>
     caregivers' quality of life
    </mark>
    . Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach involving
    <mark>
     nutritional intervention
    </mark>
    is essential to improve dietary provision and the nutritional status of children with CP.
