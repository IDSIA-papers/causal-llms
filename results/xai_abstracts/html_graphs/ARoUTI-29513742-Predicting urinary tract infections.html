    <mark>
     Urinary tract infection (UTI)
    </mark>
    is a common
    <mark>
     emergency department (ED) diagnosis
    </mark>
    with reported high
    <mark>
     diagnostic error rates
    </mark>
    . Because a
    <mark>
     urine culture
    </mark>
    , part of the gold standard for
    <mark>
     diagnosis of UTI
    </mark>
    , is usually not available for 24-48 hours after an ED visit,
    <mark>
     diagnosis
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     treatment decisions
    </mark>
    are based on
    <mark>
     symptoms
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     physical findings
    </mark>
    , and other
    <mark>
     laboratory results
    </mark>
    , potentially leading to
    <mark>
     overutilization
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     antibiotic resistance
    </mark>
    , and
    <mark>
     delayed treatment
    </mark>
    . Previous research has demonstrated inadequate
    <mark>
     diagnostic performance
    </mark>
    for both individual laboratory tests and prediction tools. Our aim, was to train, validate, and compare
    <mark>
     machine-learning based predictive models
    </mark>
    for UTI in a large diverse set of
    <mark>
     ED patients
    </mark>
    . Single-center, multi-site, retrospective cohort analysis of 80,387 adult ED visits with urine culture results and UTI symptoms. We developed models for
    <mark>
     UTI prediction
    </mark>
    with six machine learning algorithms using
    <mark>
     demographic information
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     vitals
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     laboratory results
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     medications
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     past medical history
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     chief complaint
    </mark>
    , and
    <mark>
     structured historical and physical exam findings
    </mark>
    . Models were developed with both the full set of 211 variables and a reduced set of 10 variables. UTI predictions were compared between models and to proxies of
    <mark>
     provider judgment
    </mark>
    (documentation of
    <mark>
     UTI diagnosis
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     antibiotic administration
    </mark>
    ). The machine learning models had an
    <mark>
     area under the curve
    </mark>
    ranging from 0.826-0.904, with
    <mark>
     extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
    </mark>
    the top performing algorithm for both full and reduced models. The XGBoost full and reduced models demonstrated greatly improved
    <mark>
     specificity
    </mark>
    when compared to the provider judgment proxy of UTI diagnosis OR
    <mark>
     antibiotic administration
    </mark>
    with specificity differences of 33.3 (31.3-34.3) and 29.6 (28.5-30.6), while also demonstrating superior
    <mark>
     sensitivity
    </mark>
    when compared to documentation of UTI diagnosis with sensitivity differences of 38.7 (38.1-39.4) and 33.2 (32.5-33.9). In the
    <mark>
     admission and discharge cohorts
    </mark>
    using the full XGboost model, approximately 1 in 4 patients (4109/15855) would be re-categorized from a
    <mark>
     false positive
    </mark>
    to a
    <mark>
     true negative
    </mark>
    and approximately 1 in 11 patients (1372/15855) would be re-categorized from a
    <mark>
     false negative
    </mark>
    to a
    <mark>
     true positive
    </mark>
    . The best performing machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, accurately diagnosed
    <mark>
     positive urine culture results
    </mark>
    , and outperformed previously developed models in the literature and several proxies for provider judgment. Future
    <mark>
     prospective validation
    </mark>
    is warranted.
