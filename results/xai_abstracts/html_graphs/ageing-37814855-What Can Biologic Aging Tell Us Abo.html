    <mark>
     Cardiovascular disease
    </mark>
    is often a disease of
    <mark>
     aging
    </mark>
    . Considerable advances in our understanding of the
    <mark>
     biological mechanisms
    </mark>
    of
    <mark>
     aging
    </mark>
    have been made; yet,
    <mark>
     Cardiovascular disease
    </mark>
    remains the leading cause of
    <mark>
     death
    </mark>
    in the United States urging a continued search for
    <mark>
     novel risk factors
    </mark>
    to target for preventing and treating disease.
    <mark>
     Mental stress (MS)
    </mark>
    is emerging as an important
    <mark>
     risk factor
    </mark>
    , and while progress has been made in understanding the link between
    <mark>
     MS
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     Cardiovascular disease
    </mark>
    , the precise mechanisms of a putative causal relationship require greater clarification. In the current review, we (1) summarize our current understanding of the
    <mark>
     pathological effects
    </mark>
    of
    <mark>
     MS
    </mark>
    on
    <mark>
     vascular health
    </mark>
    ; (2) describe important aspects of the
    <mark>
     pathobiology
    </mark>
    of
    <mark>
     vascular aging
    </mark>
    including
    <mark>
     inflammation
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     oxidative stress
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     mitochondrial dysfunction
    </mark>
    as well as novel processes such as
    <mark>
     genomic instability
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     epigenetic alterations
    </mark>
    , and
    <mark>
     nutrient signal pathways
    </mark>
    ; (3) highlight similarities in the
    <mark>
     downstream biologic effects
    </mark>
    of
    <mark>
     aging
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     MS
    </mark>
    on
    <mark>
     vascular health
    </mark>
    with an emphasis on
    <mark>
     cellular and molecular processes
    </mark>
    that could be used to develop
    <mark>
     novel prognostic markers
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     treatment strategies
    </mark>
    for
    <mark>
     Cardiovascular disease
    </mark>
    ; (4) discuss
    <mark>
     lifestyle
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     pharmacological methods
    </mark>
    that target
    <mark>
     indicators of aging
    </mark>
    whose role could be translated into approaches managing the effects of
    <mark>
     MS
    </mark>
    ; and (5) outline important future steps that should be considered in this area of research including the need for
    <mark>
     prospective clinical trials
    </mark>
    and for creating greater collaboration between
    <mark>
     preclinical aging researchers
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     clinical investigators
    </mark>
    managing
    <mark>
     MS
