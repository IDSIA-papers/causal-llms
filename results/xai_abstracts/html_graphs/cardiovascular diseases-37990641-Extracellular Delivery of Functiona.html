    <mark>
     Mitochondrial dysfunction
    </mark>
    alters
    <mark>
     cellular metabolism
    </mark>
    , increases
    <mark>
     tissue oxidative stress
    </mark>
    , and may be principal to the dysregulated signaling and
    <mark>
     function of CD4+ T lymphocytes
    </mark>
    in the
    <mark>
     elderly
    </mark>
    . In this proof of principle study, it is investigated whether the transfer of
    <mark>
     functional mitochondria
    </mark>
    into
    <mark>
     CD4+ T cells
    </mark>
    that are isolated from
    <mark>
     old mice
    </mark>
    (aged
    <mark>
     CD4+ T cells
    </mark>
    ), can abrogate
    <mark>
     aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction
    </mark>
    , and improve the
    <mark>
     aged CD4+ T cell functionality
    </mark>
    . The results show that the delivery of
    <mark>
     exogenous mitochondria
    </mark>
    to aged non-activated
    <mark>
     CD4+ T cells
    </mark>
    led to significant
    <mark>
     mitochondrial proteome alterations
    </mark>
    highlighted by improved
    <mark>
     aerobic metabolism
    </mark>
    and decreased
    <mark>
     cellular mitoROS
    </mark>
    . Additionally, mito-transferred aged
    <mark>
     CD4+ T cells
    </mark>
    showed improvements in
    <mark>
     activation-induced TCR-signaling kinetics
    </mark>
    displaying
    <mark>
     markers of activation (CD25)
    </mark>
    , increased
    <mark>
     IL-2 production
    </mark>
    , enhanced
    <mark>
     proliferation ex vivo
    </mark>
    . Importantly,
    <mark>
     immune deficient mouse models (RAG-KO)
    </mark>
    showed that
    <mark>
     adoptive transfer
    </mark>
    of mito-transferred naive aged
    <mark>
     CD4+ T cells
    </mark>
    , protected recipient mice from
    <mark>
     influenza A
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections
    </mark>
    . These findings support mitochondria as targets of
