    Given the link between
    <mark>
     eating behavior
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     obesity
    </mark>
    , it is critical to identify individuals who have eating behaviors which contribute to obesity etiology. This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between
    <mark>
     symptoms of anxiety
    </mark>
    and eating behaviors in
    <mark>
     patients with obesity
    </mark>
    . This was a cross-sectional study analyzing baseline characteristics of 438
    <mark>
     patients with obesity
    </mark>
    (BMI&gt;30). Patients completed the
    <mark>
     Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
    </mark>
    questionnaire, the
    <mark>
     Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire R21 (TFEQ-R21)
    </mark>
    , and the
    <mark>
     Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire (WEL)
    </mark>
    .
    <mark>
     Pearson correlation coefficients
    </mark>
    were used to evaluate the association between questionnaires. Two-sample independent t-test were conducted to examine differences in the TFEQ-R21 and WEL between low and moderate to severe levels of symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety scores (HADS-A) positively correlated with two factors of the TFEQ,
    <mark>
     emotional eating
    </mark>
    (r = 0.36) and
    <mark>
     uncontrolled eating
    </mark>
    (r = 0.27). The HADS-A score was negatively correlated with
    <mark>
     self-efficacy to resist eating
    </mark>
    in all five situational factors on the WEL (p &lt; 0.01). Patients with symptoms of anxiety additionally showed higher mean scores for emotional eating and uncontrolled eating (p &lt; 0.001, respectively),and lower levels of
    <mark>
     cognitive restraint
    </mark>
    (p = 0.04)) on the TFEQ-R21. Patients with obesity who reported having anxiety symptoms had lower self-confidence to manage their eating and more emotional eating than patients with low anxiety symptoms. Clearly more needs to be learned about symtoms of anxiety and eating behaviors.
