    <mark>
     Healthcare associated infections (HAI)
    </mark>
    are a major burden for the healthcare system and associated with
    <mark>
     prolonged hospital stay
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     increased morbidity
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     mortality
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     costs
    </mark>
    .
    <mark>
     Healthcare associated urinary tract infections (HA-UTI)
    </mark>
    accounts for about 20-30% of all HAI's, and with the emergence of
    <mark>
     multi-resistant urinary tract pathogens
    </mark>
    , the total burden of HA-UTI will most likely increase. The aim of the current study was to develop two
    <mark>
     predictive models
    </mark>
    , using data from the index admission as well as historic data on a patient, to predict the
    <mark>
     development of UTI
    </mark>
    at the time of
    <mark>
     entry to the hospital
    </mark>
    and after
    <mark>
     48 hours of admission
    </mark>
    (HA-UTI). The ultimate goal is to predict the
    <mark>
     individual patient risk
    </mark>
    of acquiring HA-UTI before it occurs so that health care professionals may take proper actions to prevent it.
    <mark>
     Retrospective cohort analysis
    </mark>
    of approx. 300 000
    <mark>
     adult admissions
    </mark>
    in a Danish region was performed. We developed models for UTI prediction with five
    <mark>
     machine-learning algorithms
    </mark>
    using
    <mark>
     demographic information
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     laboratory results
    </mark>
    , data on
    <mark>
     antibiotic treatment
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     past medical history
    </mark>
    (
    <mark>
     ICD10 codes
    </mark>
    ), and
    <mark>
     clinical data
    </mark>
    by transformation of unstructured narrative text in
    <mark>
     Electronic Medical Records
    </mark>
    to structured data by
    <mark>
     Natural Language Processing
    </mark>
    . The five machine-learning algorithms have been evaluated by the performance measures
    <mark>
     average squared error
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     cumulative lift
    </mark>
    , and
    <mark>
     area under the curve (ROC-index)
    </mark>
    . The algorithms had an
    <mark>
     area under the curve (ROC-index)
    </mark>
    ranging from 0.82 to 0.84 for the entry model (T = 0 hours after admission) and from 0.71 to 0.77 for the HA-UTI model (T = 48 hours after admission). The study is proof of concept that it is possible to create machine-learning models that can serve as
    <mark>
     early warning systems
    </mark>
    to predict patients at risk of acquiring urinary tract infections during admission. The entry model and the HA-UTI models perform with a high ROC-index indicating a sufficient
    <mark>
     sensitivity
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     specificity
    </mark>
    , which may make both models instrumental in
    <mark>
     individualized prevention of UTI
    </mark>
    in
    <mark>
     hospitalized patients
    </mark>
    . The favored machine-learning methodology is
    <mark>
     Decision Trees
    </mark>
    to ensure the most transparent results and to increase clinical understanding and implementation of the models.
