     Antibiotic resistance
    </mark>
    is prevalent among the
    <mark>
     bacterial pathogens
    </mark>
    causing
    <mark>
     urinary tract infections
    </mark>
    . However,
    <mark>
     antimicrobial treatment
    </mark>
    is often prescribed 'empirically', in the absence of
    <mark>
     antibiotic susceptibility testing
    </mark>
    , risking mismatched and therefore
    <mark>
     ineffective treatment
    </mark>
    . Here, linking a 10-year
    <mark>
     longitudinal data set
    </mark>
    of over 700,000
    <mark>
     community-acquired urinary tract infections
    </mark>
    with over 5,000,000 individually resolved records of
    <mark>
     antibiotic purchases
    </mark>
    , we identify strong associations of
    <mark>
     antibiotic resistance
    </mark>
    with the
    <mark>
     demographics
    </mark>
    , records of
    <mark>
     past urine cultures
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     history of drug purchases
    </mark>
    of the patients. When combined together, these associations allow for
    <mark>
     machine-learning-based personalized drug-specific predictions
    </mark>
    of
    <mark>
     antibiotic resistance
    </mark>
    , thereby enabling
    <mark>
     drug-prescribing algorithms
    </mark>
    that match an
    <mark>
     antibiotic treatment recommendation
    </mark>
    to the expected resistance of each sample. Applying these algorithms retrospectively, over a 1-year test period, we find that they greatly reduce the risk of
    <mark>
     mismatched treatment
    </mark>
    compared with the current
    <mark>
     standard of care
    </mark>
    . The clinical application of such algorithms may help improve the effectiveness of
    <mark>
     antimicrobial treatments
