37814918,Fulminant type 1 diabetes: Focusing on triggering factors.,"Fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1D) is a novel type of type 1 diabetes that is caused by extremely rapid destruction of the pancreatic β cells. Early diagnosis or prediction of FT1D is critical for the prevention or timely treatment of diabetes ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening. Understanding its triggers or promoting factors plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of FT1D. In this review, we summarised the various triggering factors of FT1D, including susceptibility genes, immunological factors (cellular and humoural immunity), immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, pregnancy, viral infections, and vaccine inoculation. This review provides the basis for future research into the pathogenetic mechanisms that regulate FT1D development and progression to further improve the prognosis and clinical management of patients with FT1D.",00:22:01
37814878,[Lifetide biofeedback intervention in type 2 diabetic patients: a pilot observation].,"To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of lifetide biofeedback intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We analyzed the changes in average blood glucose, estimated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels in 5 patients with T2DM undergoing lifetide biofeedback intervention without the use of hypoglycemic drugs. A transient blood glucose monitoring system was used for drug withdrawal management during the intervention. Compared with those before the intervention, the average blood glucose and fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels showed no significant changes after the intervention without using hypoglycemic drugs (P>0.05), but the estimated HbA1c was significantly decreased after the intervention (P<0.05). Two patients achieved complete remission, two showed partial remission, and one had substantially improved blood glucose levels. One patient showed a marked increase in extremity temperature after the intervention (P<0.05). Another patient had a significantly increased heart rate variability index (P<0.05) without obvious changes in heart rate after the intervention (P>0.05). By reestablishing the balance in autonomic nervous system regulation and enhancing peripheral microcirculation, lifetide biofeedback intervention helps to maintain stable blood glucose levels, achieve disease remission, and reduce the occurrence of complications in T2DM patients after discontinuation of hypoglycemic drugs without changing their lifestyles.",01:08:32
37990987,Autologous mesenchymal stem cell therapy for diabetic men with erectile dysfunction. Is it promising? A pilot study.,"to assess safety and efficacy of autologous mesenchymal bone marrow stem cell injection in penile cavernosal tissue for erectile dysfunction therapy in diabetic men. The subjects of this study were diabetic men suffering erectile dysfunction, non-responding to maximum dose of oral PDE5I. Mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells were aspirated and injected after preparation in both corpora cavernosa at 3, 9 o'clock position. Erectile function was assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function and penile Doppler study, before and after 6 months after injection. 4 patients out of 10 achieve hard erection adequate for satisfactory coitus, and 2 patients achieved penile hardness with addition of pharmacological therapy with sildenafil 100mg. Peak systolic velocity increased significantly in 4 patients (2 arteriogenic and 2 mixed erectile dysfunction), from 12∼22 cm/s to 32∼69 cm/s. Variations in end-diastolic velocity increased substantially in 2 patients with venogenic insufficiency alone at follow-up from 4∼5 cm /s to -4∼-3 cm/s. Despite promising stem cell treatment efficacy for patients with erectile dysfunction, more clinical studies and researches are still warranted.",00:47:04
37990793,Effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination on hospitalization and death in the adult and older adult diabetic population: a systematic review.,"Diabetic patients are at ahigher risk of getting pneumococcal disease and are therefore recommended toget vaccinated. The aim of our systematic review is the retrieval and analysisof all available evidence on the effect of pneumococcal vaccination on the riskof hospitalization and death in adult patients with diabetes. MEDLINEand EMBASE were searched from inception until January 2023. We included allstudies investigating whether pneumococcal vaccination reduces the risk ofdying or being hospitalized in diabetic patients. The Newcastle-Ottawa scalewas used to assess risk of bias. Only two studies, encompassing atotal of 68,246 subjects, were considered eligible for inclusion and of highquality. In both studies polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination was associatedwith a reduction of the risk of hospitalization or death in adult diabeticpatients (aHR: 0.76 in one study, aOR: 0.97 in the other one). However, inneither of the two included studies the lower risk was statisticallysignificant. Further research is needed dueto the potentially major clinical implications for diabetic patients. Theresults of this systematic review can serve as a foundation for future studies,indicating the importance of continuing research in this area to improvepatient outcomes.",00:25:08
37990724,Association between anxiety and eating behaviors in patients with obesity.,"Given the link between eating behavior and obesity, it is critical to identify individuals who have eating behaviors which contribute to obesity etiology. This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between symptoms of anxiety and eating behaviors in patients with obesity. This was a cross-sectional study analyzing baseline characteristics of 438 patients with obesity (BMI>30). Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire R21 (TFEQ-R21), and the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire (WEL). Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the association between questionnaires. Two-sample independent t-test were conducted to examine differences in the TFEQ-R21 and WEL between low and moderate to severe levels of symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety scores (HADS-A) positively correlated with two factors of the TFEQ, emotional eating (r = 0.36) and uncontrolled eating (r = 0.27). The HADS-A score was negatively correlated with self-efficacy to resist eating in all five situational factors on the WEL (p < 0.01). Patients with symptoms of anxiety additionally showed higher mean scores for emotional eating and uncontrolled eating (p < 0.001, respectively),and lower levels of cognitive restraint (p = 0.04)) on the TFEQ-R21. Patients with obesity who reported having anxiety symptoms had lower self-confidence to manage their eating and more emotional eating than patients with low anxiety symptoms. Clearly more needs to be learned about symtoms of anxiety and eating behaviors.",00:25:00
