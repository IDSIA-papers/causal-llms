    <mark>
     Diabetic patients
    </mark>
    are at a higher risk of getting
    <mark>
     pneumococcal disease
    </mark>
    and are therefore recommended to get
    <mark>
     vaccinated
    </mark>
    . The aim of our systematic review is the retrieval and analysis of all available evidence on the effect of
    <mark>
     pneumococcal vaccination
    </mark>
    on the
    <mark>
     risk of hospitalization
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     death
    </mark>
    in
    <mark>
     adult patients with diabetes
    </mark>
    .
    <mark>
     MEDLINE
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     EMBASE
    </mark>
    were searched from inception until January 2023. We included all studies investigating whether
    <mark>
     pneumococcal vaccination
    </mark>
    reduces the
    <mark>
     risk of dying or being hospitalized
    </mark>
    in
    <mark>
     diabetic patients
    </mark>
    . The
    <mark>
     Newcastle-Ottawa scale
    </mark>
    was used to assess risk of bias. Only two studies, encompassing a total of 68,246 subjects, were considered eligible for inclusion and of high quality. In both studies
    <mark>
     polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination
    </mark>
    was associated with a
    <mark>
     reduction of the risk of hospitalization or death
    </mark>
    in
    <mark>
     adult diabetic patients
    </mark>
    (aHR: 0.76 in one study, aOR: 0.97 in the other one). However, in neither of the two included studies the lower risk was
    <mark>
     statistically significant
    </mark>
    . Further research is needed due to the potentially major
    <mark>
     clinical implications
    </mark>
    for
    <mark>
     diabetic patients
    </mark>
    . The results of this
    <mark>
     systematic review
    </mark>
    can serve as a foundation for future studies, indicating the importance of continuing research in this area to improve
    <mark>
     patient outcomes
    </mark>
    .
