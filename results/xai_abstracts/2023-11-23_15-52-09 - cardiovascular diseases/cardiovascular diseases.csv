37990434,Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Hydrogen Sulfide in Maintaining Polarity and mtDNA Integrity with a Multichannel Fluorescent Probe.,"Abnormal mitochondrial state has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, myopathies, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Assessing mitochondrial functionality can be achieved by monitoring alterations in mitochondrial polarity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, which serve as valuable biomarkers. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous signaling molecule, plays a regulatory role in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, ATP synthesis, and calcium ion balance, thereby influencing cellular metabolism and signal transduction. Investigating the interplay between mitochondrial H2S, polarity, and mtDNA can enhance our understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms involved in H2S-mediated mitochondrial functions. To address this, we designed a mitochondria-targeted multichannel fluorescent probe, HNA, capable of cascaded detection of H2S and polarity, as well as parallel detection of mtDNA. The probe exhibited a significant turn-on response to H2S, emitting at approximately 604 nm, while the product HNAP demonstrated high sensitivity to polarity within the wavelength range of 526-591 nm. Additionally, the probe was able to bind to DNA, resulting in an enhanced long-wave emission at 668 nm. Facilitated by HNA, our study provides novel insights into the role of mitochondrial H2S in maintaining mitochondrial polarity and validates its protective effect on mtDNA through antioxidative mechanisms. Overall, this work proposes a potential therapeutic strategy for modulating the inflammatory process in mitochondrial-related diseases.",01:56:48
37990583,Paediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to Danon disease.,"Danon disease is a rare X-linked disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2. We report a case of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy secondary to a novel mutation in the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 gene in a 10-year-old male adolescent. We performed a modified extended Morrow procedure to minimise the risk of death and improve the patient's quality of life. The patient did not have exertional dyspnoea, and auscultation did not reveal a cardiac murmur at 1-year follow-up.",00:28:22
37990641,Extracellular Delivery of Functional Mitochondria Rescues the Dysfunction of CD4+ T Cells in Aging.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction alters cellular metabolism, increases tissue oxidative stress, and may be principal to the dysregulated signaling and function of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the elderly. In this proof of principle study, it is investigated whether the transfer of functional mitochondria into CD4+ T cells that are isolated from old mice (aged CD4+ T cells), can abrogate aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, and improve the aged CD4+ T cell functionality. The results show that the delivery of exogenous mitochondria to aged non-activated CD4+ T cells led to significant mitochondrial proteome alterations highlighted by improved aerobic metabolism and decreased cellular mitoROS. Additionally, mito-transferred aged CD4+ T cells showed improvements in activation-induced TCR-signaling kinetics displaying markers of activation (CD25), increased IL-2 production, enhanced proliferation ex vivo. Importantly, immune deficient mouse models (RAG-KO) showed that adoptive transfer of mito-transferred naive aged CD4+ T cells, protected recipient mice from influenza A and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. These findings support mitochondria as targets of therapeutic intervention in aging.",01:49:27
37990425,Radioprotective Potency of Nanoceria.,"Cancer presents a significant medical challenge that requires effective management. Current cancer treatment options, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, have limitations in terms of their efficacy and the potential harm they can cause to normal tissues. In response, researchers have been focusing on developing adjuvants that can enhance tumor responses while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Among the promising options, nanoceria (NC), a type of nanoparticle composed of cerium oxide, has garnered attention for its potential to improve various cancer treatment regimens. Nanoceria has demonstrated its ability to exhibit toxicity towards cancer cells, inhibit invasion, and sensitize cancer cells to both radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The remarkable aspect is that nanoceria show minimal toxicity to normal tissues while protecting against various forms of reactive oxygen species generation. Its capability to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy has also been observed. This paper thoroughly reviews the current literature on nanoceria's applications within different cancer treatment modalities, with a specific focus on radiotherapy. The emphasis is on nanoceria's unique role in enhancing tumor radiosensitization and safeguarding normal tissues from radiation damage.",00:46:51
37990276,Myocardial dysfunction assessed by speckle-tracking in good-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage patients (WFNS 1-2): a prospective observational study.,"Cardiac complications due to non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are usually described using classical echocardiographic evaluation. Strain imaging appears to have better sensitivity than standard echocardiographic markers for the diagnosis of left ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction defined as a Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) ≥  - 20% in patients with good-grade SAH (WFNS 1 or 2). Seventy-six patients with good-grade SAH were prospectively enrolled and analyzed at admission for neurocritical care. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on days 1, 3, and 7 after hemorrhage. Routine measurements, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), were performed, and off-line analysis was performed by a blinded examiner, to determine 2-, 3-, and 4-cavity longitudinal strain and left ventricular GLS. GLS was considered altered if it was ≥  - 20%, we also interested the value of ≥  - 17%. LVEF was considered altered if it was < 50%. On day 1, 60.6% of patients had GLS ≥  - 20% and 21.2% of patient had GLS ≥  - 17%. In comparison, alteration of LVEF was present in only 1.7% of patients. The concordance rate between LVEF < 50% and GLS ≥  - 20% and LVEF ≥ 50% and GLS <  - 20% was 46%. Strain imaging showed a higher prevalence (60.6%) of left ventricular dysfunction during the acute phase of good-grade SAH (WFNS 1 or 2) than previously described.",00:37:08
