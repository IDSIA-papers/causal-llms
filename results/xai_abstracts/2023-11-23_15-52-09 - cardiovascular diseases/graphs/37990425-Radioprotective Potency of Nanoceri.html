     Cancer
    </mark>
    presents a significant medical challenge that requires effective management. Current
    <mark>
     cancer
    </mark>
    treatment options, such as
    <mark>
     chemotherapy
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     targeted therapy
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     radiotherapy
    </mark>
    , and
    <mark>
     immunotherapy
    </mark>
    , have limitations in terms of their
    <mark>
     efficacy
    </mark>
    and the potential
    <mark>
     harm
    </mark>
    they can cause to
    <mark>
     normal tissues
    </mark>
    . In response, researchers have been focusing on developing
    <mark>
     adjuvants
    </mark>
    that can enhance
    <mark>
     tumor responses
    </mark>
    while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Among the promising options,
    <mark>
     nanoceria (NC)
    </mark>
    , a type of nanoparticle composed of
    <mark>
     cerium oxide
    </mark>
    , has garnered attention for its potential to improve various
    <mark>
     cancer
    </mark>
    treatment regimens.
    <mark>
     Nanoceria
    </mark>
    has demonstrated its ability to exhibit
    <mark>
     toxicity towards cancer cells
    </mark>
    ,
    <mark>
     inhibit invasion
    </mark>
    , and
    <mark>
     sensitize cancer cells
    </mark>
    to both
    <mark>
     radiation therapy
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     chemotherapy
    </mark>
    . The remarkable aspect is that
    <mark>
     nanoceria
    </mark>
    show
    <mark>
     minimal toxicity to normal tissues
    </mark>
    while protecting against various forms of
    <mark>
     reactive oxygen species generation
    </mark>
    . Its capability to
    <mark>
     enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells
    </mark>
    to
    <mark>
     chemotherapy
    </mark>
    and
    <mark>
     radiotherapy
    </mark>
    has also been observed. This paper thoroughly reviews the current literature on
    <mark>
     nanoceria's
    </mark>
    applications within different
    <mark>
     cancer
    </mark>
    treatment modalities, with a specific focus on
    <mark>
     radiotherapy
    </mark>
    . The emphasis is on
    <mark>
     nanoceria's
    </mark>
    unique role in enhancing
    <mark>
     tumor radiosensitization
    </mark>
    and safeguarding
    <mark>
     normal tissues
    </mark>
    from
    <mark>
     radiation damage
    </mark>
    .
