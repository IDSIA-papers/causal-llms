    <mark>
     Antibiotic resistance
    </mark>
    is a major cause of
    <mark>
     treatment failure
    </mark>
    and leads to increased
    <mark>
     use of broad-spectrum agents
    </mark>
    , which begets further
    <mark>
     resistance
    </mark>
    . This vicious cycle is epitomized by
    <mark>
     uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI)
    </mark>
    , which affects one in two
    <mark>
     women
    </mark>
    during their life and is associated with increasing
    <mark>
     antibiotic resistance
    </mark>
    and high rates of
    <mark>
     prescription for broad-spectrum second-line agents
    </mark>
    . To address this, we developed
    <mark>
     machine learning models
    </mark>
    to
    <mark>
     predict antibiotic susceptibility
    </mark>
    using
    <mark>
     electronic health record data
    </mark>
    and built a
    <mark>
     decision algorithm
    </mark>
    for recommending the
    <mark>
     narrowest possible antibiotic
    </mark>
    to which a specimen is susceptible. When applied to a
    <mark>
     test cohort
    </mark>
    of 3629 patients presenting between 2014 and 2016, the algorithm achieved a 67% reduction in the
    <mark>
     use of second-line antibiotics
    </mark>
    relative to
    <mark>
     clinicians
    </mark>
    . At the same time, it reduced
    <mark>
     inappropriate antibiotic therapy
    </mark>
    , defined as the choice of a
    <mark>
     treatment
    </mark>
    to which a specimen is resistant, by 18% relative to
    <mark>
     clinicians
    </mark>
    . For specimens where
    <mark>
     clinicians
    </mark>
    chose a
    <mark>
     second-line drug
    </mark>
    but the algorithm chose a
    <mark>
     first-line drug
    </mark>
    , 92% (1066 of 1157) of decisions ended up being susceptible to the
    <mark>
     first-line drug
    </mark>
    . When
    <mark>
     clinicians
    </mark>
    chose an inappropriate
    <mark>
     first-line drug
    </mark>
    , the algorithm chose an appropriate
    <mark>
     first-line drug
    </mark>
    47% (183 of 392) of the time. Our
    <mark>
     machine learning decision algorithm
    </mark>
    provides
    <mark>
     antibiotic stewardship
    </mark>
    for a common
    <mark>
     infectious syndrome
    </mark>
    by maximizing

     reductions in broad-spectrum antibiotic use
    </mark>
    while maintaining optimal
    <mark>
     treatment outcomes
    </mark>
    . Further work is necessary to improve

    </mark>
    by training models in more
