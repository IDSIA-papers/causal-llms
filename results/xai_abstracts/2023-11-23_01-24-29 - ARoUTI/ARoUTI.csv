31273328,Personal clinical history predicts antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infections.,"Antibiotic resistance is prevalent among the bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections. However, antimicrobial treatment is often prescribed 'empirically', in the absence of antibiotic susceptibility testing, risking mismatched and therefore ineffective treatment. Here, linking a 10-year longitudinal data set of over 700,000 community-acquired urinary tract infections with over 5,000,000 individually resolved records of antibiotic purchases, we identify strong associations of antibiotic resistance with the demographics, records of past urine cultures and history of drug purchases of the patients. When combined together, these associations allow for machine-learning-based personalized drug-specific predictions of antibiotic resistance, thereby enabling drug-prescribing algorithms that match an antibiotic treatment recommendation to the expected resistance of each sample. Applying these algorithms retrospectively, over a 1-year test period, we find that they greatly reduce the risk of mismatched treatment compared with the current standard of care. The clinical application of such algorithms may help improve the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments.",00:53:13
33148625,A decision algorithm to promote outpatient antimicrobial stewardship for uncomplicated urinary tract infection.,"Antibiotic resistance is a major cause of treatment failure and leads to increased use of broad-spectrum agents, which begets further resistance. This vicious cycle is epitomized by uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), which affects one in two women during their life and is associated with increasing antibiotic resistance and high rates of prescription for broad-spectrum second-line agents. To address this, we developed machine learning models to predict antibiotic susceptibility using electronic health record data and built a decision algorithm for recommending the narrowest possible antibiotic to which a specimen is susceptible. When applied to a test cohort of 3629 patients presenting between 2014 and 2016, the algorithm achieved a 67% reduction in the use of second-line antibiotics relative to clinicians. At the same time, it reduced inappropriate antibiotic therapy, defined as the choice of a treatment to which a specimen is resistant, by 18% relative to clinicians. For specimens where clinicians chose a second-line drug but the algorithm chose a first-line drug, 92% (1066 of 1157) of decisions ended up being susceptible to the first-line drug. When clinicians chose an inappropriate first-line drug, the algorithm chose an appropriate first-line drug 47% (183 of 392) of the time. Our machine learning decision algorithm provides antibiotic stewardship for a common infectious syndrome by maximizing reductions in broad-spectrum antibiotic use while maintaining optimal treatment outcomes. Further work is necessary to improve generalizability by training models in more diverse populations.",01:28:11
35013613,Direct antimicrobial resistance prediction from clinical MALDI-TOF mass spectra using machine learning.,"Early use of effective antimicrobial treatments is critical for the outcome of infections and the prevention of treatment resistance. Antimicrobial resistance testing enables the selection of optimal antibiotic treatments, but current culture-based techniques can take up to 72â€‰hours to generate results. We have developed a novel machine learning approach to predict antimicrobial resistance directly from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra profiles of clinical isolates. We trained calibrated classifiers on a newly created publicly available database of mass spectra profiles from the clinically most relevant isolates with linked antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes. This dataset combines more than 300,000 mass spectra with more than 750,000 antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from four medical institutions. Validation on a panel of clinically important pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resulting in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80, 0.74 and 0.74, respectively, demonstrated the potential of using machine learning to substantially accelerate antimicrobial resistance determination and change of clinical management. Furthermore, a retrospective clinical case study of 63 patients found that implementing this approach would have changed the clinical treatment in nine cases, which would have been beneficial in eight cases (89%). MALDI-TOF mass spectra-based machine learning may thus be an important new tool for treatment optimization and antibiotic stewardship.",01:57:12
29513742,Predicting urinary tract infections in the emergency department with machine learning.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common emergency department (ED) diagnosis with reported high diagnostic error rates. Because a urine culture, part of the gold standard for diagnosis of UTI, is usually not available for 24-48 hours after an ED visit, diagnosis and treatment decisions are based on symptoms, physical findings, and other laboratory results, potentially leading to overutilization, antibiotic resistance, and delayed treatment. Previous research has demonstrated inadequate diagnostic performance for both individual laboratory tests and prediction tools. Our aim, was to train, validate, and compare machine-learning based predictive models for UTI in a large diverse set of ED patients. Single-center, multi-site, retrospective cohort analysis of 80,387 adult ED visits with urine culture results and UTI symptoms. We developed models for UTI prediction with six machine learning algorithms using demographic information, vitals, laboratory results, medications, past medical history, chief complaint, and structured historical and physical exam findings. Models were developed with both the full set of 211 variables and a reduced set of 10 variables. UTI predictions were compared between models and to proxies of provider judgment (documentation of UTI diagnosis and antibiotic administration). The machine learning models had an area under the curve ranging from 0.826-0.904, with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) the top performing algorithm for both full and reduced models. The XGBoost full and reduced models demonstrated greatly improved specificity when compared to the provider judgment proxy of UTI diagnosis OR antibiotic administration with specificity differences of 33.3 (31.3-34.3) and 29.6 (28.5-30.6), while also demonstrating superior sensitivity when compared to documentation of UTI diagnosis with sensitivity differences of 38.7 (38.1-39.4) and 33.2 (32.5-33.9). In the admission and discharge cohorts using the full XGboost model, approximately 1 in 4 patients (4109/15855) would be re-categorized from a false positive to a true negative and approximately 1 in 11 patients (1372/15855) would be re-categorized from a false negative to a true positive. The best performing machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, accurately diagnosed positive urine culture results, and outperformed previously developed models in the literature and several proxies for provider judgment. Future prospective validation is warranted.",05:15:27
33788888,Prediction of risk of acquiring urinary tract infection during hospital stay based on machine-learning: A retrospective cohort study.,"Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are a major burden for the healthcare system and associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Healthcare associated urinary tract infections (HA-UTI) accounts for about 20-30% of all HAI's, and with the emergence of multi-resistant urinary tract pathogens, the total burden of HA-UTI will most likely increase. The aim of the current study was to develop two predictive models, using data from the index admission as well as historic data on a patient, to predict the development of UTI at the time of entry to the hospital and after 48 hours of admission (HA-UTI). The ultimate goal is to predict the individual patient risk of acquiring HA-UTI before it occurs so that health care professionals may take proper actions to prevent it. Retrospective cohort analysis of approx. 300 000 adult admissions in a Danish region was performed. We developed models for UTI prediction with five machine-learning algorithms using demographic information, laboratory results, data on antibiotic treatment, past medical history (ICD10 codes), and clinical data by transformation of unstructured narrative text in Electronic Medical Records to structured data by Natural Language Processing. The five machine-learning algorithms have been evaluated by the performance measures average squared error, cumulative lift, and area under the curve (ROC-index). The algorithms had an area under the curve (ROC-index) ranging from 0.82 to 0.84 for the entry model (T = 0 hours after admission) and from 0.71 to 0.77 for the HA-UTI model (T = 48 hours after admission). The study is proof of concept that it is possible to create machine-learning models that can serve as early warning systems to predict patients at risk of acquiring urinary tract infections during admission. The entry model and the HA-UTI models perform with a high ROC-index indicating a sufficient sensitivity and specificity, which may make both models instrumental in individualized prevention of UTI in hospitalized patients. The favored machine-learning methodology is Decision Trees to ensure the most transparent results and to increase clinical understanding and implementation of the models.",04:53:35
