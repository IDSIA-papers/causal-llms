37814948,Ellagic acid reduces hepatic lipid contents through regulation of SIRT1 and AMPK in old rats.,"Ellagic acid is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of lipid disorders. In this study, the effects of ellagic acid on key regulators of lipid metabolism, and histopathological alterations in aged liver were examined. A total of 21 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups, including young control, old control, and old ellagic acid. After one month of treatment with ellagic acid, the expression levels of hepatic SIRT1, AMPK, SREBP-1c, PPAR-α, and phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) were evaluated. The levels of several serum biochemical factors, and hepatic triglyceride, and cholesterol contents were assessed. Ellagic acid elevated the levels of SIRT1, p-AMPK, and PPAR-α and reduced SREBP-1c level in the liver of old rats. It decreased triglyceride and cholesterol contents in the aged liver and improved histopathological changes. The results demonstrated that ellagic acid can exert protective effects against hepatic lipid metabolism disorders induced by ageing.","['AMPK', 'Ellagic acid', 'PPAR-α', 'SIRT1', 'SREBP-1c', 'ageing', 'lipid metabolism', 'liver']",
37814920,The association between frailty and perceived physical and mental fatigability: The Long Life Family Study.,"Higher levels of frailty, quantified by a frailty index (FI), may be linked to fatigue severity as tasks become more physically and mentally demanding. Fatigue, a component of frailty research, has been ambiguous and inconsistent in its operationalization. Fatigability-the quantification of vulnerability to fatigue in relation to specific intensity and duration of activities-offers a more sensitive and standardized approach, though the association between frailty and fatigability has not been assessed. Using cross-sectional data from the Long Life Family Study at Visit 2 (2014-2017; N = 2524; mean age ± standard deviation (SD) 71.4 ± 11.2 years; 55% women; 99% White), we examined associations between an 83-item FI after excluding fatigue items (ratio of number of health problems reported (numerator) out of the total assessed (denominator); higher ratio = greater frailty) and perceived physical and mental fatigability using the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) (range 0-50; higher scores = greater fatigability). Participants had mean ± standard deviation FI (0.08 ± 0.06; observed range: 0.0-0.43), PFS Physical (13.7 ± 9.6; 39.5% more severe, ≥15), and PFS Mental (7.9 ± 8.9; 22.8% more severe, ≥13). The prevalence of more severe physical and mental fatigability was higher across FI quartiles. In mixed effects models accounting for family structure, a clinically meaningful 3%-higher FI was associated with 1.9 points higher PFS Physical score (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-2.1) and 1.7 points higher PFS Mental score (95% CI 1.5-1.9) after adjusting for covariates. Frailty was associated with perceived physical and mental fatigability severity. Understanding this association may support the development of interventions to mitigate the risks associated with greater frailty and perceived fatigability. Including measurements of perceived fatigability, in lieu of fatigue, in frailty indices has the potential to alleviate the inconsistencies and ambiguity surrounding the operationalization of fatigue and provide a more precise and sensitive measurement of frailty.","['epidemiology', 'fatigue', 'risk factor']",2023-05-12
37814855,What Can Biologic Aging Tell Us About the Effects of Mental Stress on Vascular Health.,"Cardiovascular disease is often a disease of aging. Considerable advances in our understanding of the biological mechanisms of aging have been made; yet, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States urging a continued search for novel risk factors to target for preventing and treating disease. Mental stress (MS) is emerging as an important risk factor, and while progress has been made in understanding the link between MS and cardiovascular disease, the precise mechanisms of a putative causal relationship require greater clarification. In the current review, we (1) summarize our current understanding of the pathological effects of MS on vascular health; (2) describe important aspects of the pathobiology of vascular aging including inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as novel processes such as genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and nutrient signal pathways; (3) highlight similarities in the downstream biologic effects of aging and MS on vascular health with an emphasis on cellular and molecular processes that could be used to develop novel prognostic markers and treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease; (4) discuss lifestyle and pharmacological methods that target indicators of aging whose role could be translated into approaches managing the effects of MS; and (5) outline important future steps that should be considered in this area of research including the need for prospective clinical trials and for creating greater collaboration between preclinical aging researchers and clinical investigators managing MS.","['aging', 'biologic indicators', 'endothelial function', 'mental stress', 'vascular health']",
37814717,Nutritional status as predictors for quality of life among caregivers of children with severe cerebral palsy.,"Individuals with severe cerebral palsy (CP) often experience various health issues, including feeding difficulties, which can adversely affect their nutritional status and caregivers' quality of life, e.g., more time spent for feeding rather than own selfcare. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of poor nutritional status among individuals with severe CP and explore its role as predictors for caregivers' quality of life. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a government hospital (Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital), Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Program, and Spastic Centre [non-profit organization (NGO)] in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Seventy-one participants with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level IV and V were recruited. Sociodemographic data, health-associated data, and anthropometric data were collected. Caregivers' quality of life was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) CP module version 3.0 which included domains such as Movement and Balance, Eating Activities, and School Activities. Most participants were males (60.6%), with 61 classified as level IV in the GMFCS classification. According to the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS), 59 children were at level IV. In total, 40.8% were underweight according to CP growth chart and 49.3% had mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) readings below the 5th percentile. The lowest scores in the PedsQL CP module version 3.0 were observed in the Daily Activities (5.34±10.87), and School Activities domains (8.15±18.65). Sociodemographic and anthropometric data, including body mass index (BMI)-for-age, MUAC, body fat, triceps, and subscapular skinfold measurement, were predictors for the School Activities domain [F (11, 44)=3.981, P<0.005, R2=0.499]. Poor nutritional status in individuals with severe CP has been shown to negatively impact caregivers' quality of life. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach involving nutritional intervention is essential to improve dietary provision and the nutritional status of children with CP.","['Neurological disorder', 'feeding difficulties', 'nutritional intervention', 'poor nutritional status', 'quality of life']",2023-03-24
37814692,The impact of cognitive impairment in urologic implants: a narrative review.,"With the general population aging and thus more patients developing bothersome erectile dysfunction, stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder, there will likely be a higher demand for three common interactive implants in urology, the penile prosthesis, artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM). Further, the prevalence of mild and major neurocognitive disorders (also known as mild cognitive impairment and dementia, respectively) is expected to increase. While the aforementioned urologic implants have excellent short and long term outcomes, there are also known device issues such as malfunction or misuse that may require surgical removal and/or revision. The objective of this narrative review is to describe the association of cognitive impairment and urologic implants. We performed a search on PubMed between the years 1975-2023 for English language articles that reported on any type or severity of cognitive impairment and its association with penile prosthesis, AUS and/or SNM. While peer-reviewed published manuscripts were prioritized, abstracts that fit our search criteria were also included. Data assessing outcomes of patients with cognitive impairment who undergo placement of a urologic implant are limited. There is an association between AUS failure or misuse with cognitive impairment. SNM is efficacious in this population in the short term. In patients who develop dementia, an inflatable penile prosthesis can be deflated via in-office needle puncture and an AUS can be deactivated. The Memory Alteration Test, Quick Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment and the Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination are relatively quick screening tests with good sensitivity and specificity for mild cognitive impairment. While data on the association between urologic implants and cognitive impairment are sparse, there are tools that urologists can use to screen patients for cognitive impairment. With screening, urologists can provide appropriate preoperative counseling (including recommending against implantation) and can provide closer postoperative monitoring. Further study is required to assess which patients should be excluded from device implantation and how to properly assess for cognitive impairment in a manner that is both beneficial for the patient and convenient and efficient for a urologist.","['Inflatable penile prosthesis', 'artificial urinary sphincter (AUS)', 'cognitive impairment', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'sacral neuromodulation (SNM)']",2023-04-13
